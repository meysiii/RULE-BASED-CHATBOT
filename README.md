# 🤖 RULE-BASED CHATBOT
# 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m M.S. Meysintha, a 2nd-year B.E. Computer Science and Engineering student at V.S.B College of Engineering Technical Campus, Coimbatore.

This repository contains my Rule-Based Chatbot Project, developed as part of my learning journey in Artificial Intelligence fundamentals and chatbot development.

The chatbot works using predefined rules and pattern matching, making it simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly. This project helped me understand the core logic behind chatbot design before moving on to advanced AI and NLP-based models.

# 📄 Project Description

The Rule-Based Chatbot is a simple chatbot that generates automated responses based on if–else conditions and keyword matching.

Unlike AI-powered chatbots that depend on machine learning or NLP models, this chatbot follows fixed rules to simulate basic human-like conversations.

# ✨ Features

Responds to user queries using predefined rules

Simple and beginner-friendly implementation

Easy to customize by adding new rules and responses

Works completely offline (no APIs required)

Clean and interactive chat interface

# 🔧 Tech Stack

HTML – Structure of the chatbot interface

CSS – Styling and responsive UI design

JavaScript – Rule-based logic and interaction handling

# 🚀 How It Works

The user enters a message in the chatbot input box

The input is processed using predefined rules in JavaScript

If a matching rule is found, the chatbot returns a response

If no rule matches, a default fallback response is shown

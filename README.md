# RULE-BASED-CHATBOT

# Introduction 👋

Hi, I’m M.S. Meysintha, a 2nd-year B.E. CSE student at V.S.B College of Engineering Technical Campus, Coimbatore. This repository contains my Rule-Based Chatbot Project, which I developed as part of my journey into Artificial Intelligence and chatbot development.

The chatbot works on predefined rules and patterns to generate responses, making it simple, lightweight, and beginner-friendly. This project helped me strengthen my skills in programming and understand the core logic behind chatbot design before moving into advanced AI-based models.

# DESCRIPTION

# Rule-Based Chatbot 🤖

This project is a rule-based chatbot designed to provide automated responses using predefined patterns and rules. Unlike AI-powered chatbots that rely on machine learning or NLP models, this chatbot uses if–else conditions, keyword matching, and pattern-based logic to simulate simple human-like conversations.

# ✨ Features

Responds to user queries using predefined rules

Lightweight and beginner-friendly implementation

Easy to customize with new rules and responses

Works offline without the need for external APIs

Suitable for learning chatbot fundamentals

# 🔧 Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python (or C / C++ / Java – mention your actual language)

Logic: Rule-based (keyword and pattern matching)

Interface: Console-based (or GUI if you added one)

# 🚀 How It Works

User enters a message through the console/GUI.

The chatbot matches the input with predefined rules.

A suitable response is returned if a match is found; otherwise, a default fallback response is displayed.

# 📚 Use Cases

Educational purpose: Understanding how chatbots work internally

Simple Q&A systems

Basic customer support simulation

Entertainment through predefined conversations

# 🔮 Future Improvements

Add Natural Language Processing (NLP) support

Integrate with a database for scalable responses

Connect with messaging platforms (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc.)
